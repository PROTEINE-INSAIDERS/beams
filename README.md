# Beams framework

Beams is a distributed programming framework for Scala based on idea of [code mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_mobility).
It utilizes [ZIO](https://github.com/zio/zio) to provide high-level safe and composable abstractions for writing
distributed programs and uses [Akka](https://akka.io/) to run them in distributed environments.

See [hello-world](\examples\hello-world\src\main\scala\Main.scala) application for introductory example.
